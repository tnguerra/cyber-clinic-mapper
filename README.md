## Short Description
Cyber Clinic Online provides accessible, practical tools for cyber analysts, starting with a CVE-to-CWE mapping and analysis engine. This prototype helps analysts quickly assess vulnerabilities, prioritize threats, and deliver cost-efficient recommendations ideally leveling the cybersecurity playing field.

## Project Plan
To develop the core diagnostic engine of a user-friendly cyber “clinic” which would be a tool that enables cyber analysts to quickly and efficiently map CVEs to CWEs, assess cybersecurity posture, and generate actionable reports. This first phase will deliver a cost-efficient, accessible solution that supports analysts in providing “clinic-style” recommendations, improving both speed and accessibility of cybersecurity assessments.
